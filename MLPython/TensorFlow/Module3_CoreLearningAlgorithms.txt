1. Linear Regression
   - Most basic form of ML
   - used to predict numeric values
   - most useful when you have data points that correlate in linear fashion
   - line of best fit refers to a line through a scatter plot of data points that best expresses the relationship between points
   - linear approach to modelling a relationship between a target (dependent) variable and one or more explanatory variables (independent) variables
   - Equation of a line y = mx + b
     - m = slope of line (rise vs run)
     - b = y-intercept
   - close to as many data points as possible with even split of points
