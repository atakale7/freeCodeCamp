- TensorFlow is an open source framework developed by Google Brain Team
- aim is to make machine learning, deep learning and neural networks easier to use

- Introduction: Machine Learning Fundamentals
  - Artificial Intelligence
    - Effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans
    - Evolved in 1950s - Can computers think?
    - Initially thought as predefined set of rules
    - very good AI was just a very good set of rules
    - AI can be simple (specific task) or complex (ability to perform multiple tasks)
    - simulating intellectual human behavior
  - Machine Learning
    - ML figures out the rules for us
    - Take the input data and take the output and find patterns and generates rules
    - Classical Programming models - Data and Rules -> Answers
    - Machine Learning models - Data and Answers -> Rules
    - Goal for machine learning models -> achieve the highest accuracy possible
    - Rather than giving program the rules, an algorithm finds the rules for us
  - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
    - form of ML that used a layered representation of data
    - Input layer, hidden layer and output layer
    - multi-stage information extraction
    - inspired from biological concept of human learning - not neccessarily models it
  - Data
    - features, independent variable, input to model
    - label, output, dependant variable, target
    - tons of data is required for training the model
